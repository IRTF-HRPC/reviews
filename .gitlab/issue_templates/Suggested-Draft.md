## Content relevance

- **Are members of the review team already engaged in the working group?**
- **Has the RFC received attention or been controversial?**

## Status
- **Can comments be submitted before the last call deadline?**
- **Would commentary on an RFC lead to a new I-D?**
- **Would commentary on an RFC be a useful case study in applying the guidelines?**

## Simplicity
- **Is the I-D or RFC self-contained enough, eg not too much reliance on
other RFCs to the point where our comments on the specific document at
hand are irrelevant?** 
- **Is the I-D or RFC short and straight-forward, eg not overly
complicated or generally too time consuming?**

## Implementation
- **Is the I-D or RFC likely to be implemented by providers up stream?**
- **Is the I-D or RFC widely supported, eg not generally considered by
the IETF community to be ignored?**
- **Is the RFC, or the RFC that is being revised by an I-D, widely
implemented already?**

## Relationships
- **Has the I-D or RFC been drafted by individuals or entities engaged
in the research team or HRPC?**
- **Has the I-D or RFC been drafted by individuals or entities with whom
we could partner on, or who would be amenable to improvements?**
