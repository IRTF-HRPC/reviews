I think the current draft version does a good job of enumerating the privacy challenges. The issue is that we are moving the privacy risk away from a malicious web page to a malicious actor in your local network. Review for the latest version (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-mdns-ice-candidates-02):


Section 3.2:
>   An ICE agent may use a hostname resolver that transparently supports
>   both Multicast and Unicast DNS.  In this case the resolution of a
>   ".local" name may happen through Unicast DNS as noted in [RFC6762],
>   Section 3.

This might mean that a DNS request containing {UUID}.local name would be sent out to the larger Internet, which would increase the risk of the privacy issues noted in the document.

Section 5.1:
It seems that this would require a corresponding update to https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc-stats/#icecandidate-dict*? 

Section 5.3:
Why SHOULD instead of MUST in this section? Also s/important/crucial in the first sentence. Given that we are generating universally unique identifiers, if we do not expire these identifiers, they will make matters much worse from a tracking perspective.

Section 6.3:
This is a serious issue. Wondering if this could be mitigated by the browser additionally spoofing MAC addresses for the network interfaces. There of course might be policy problems with this.
