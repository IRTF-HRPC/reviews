# Human Rights Reviews

Human rights reviews apply a human rights considerations model to examine Internet Drafts and RFCs, and further help evaluate the usefulness of RFC8280 and human rights considerations guidelines.

Human Rights Considerations
- RFC8280 'Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations': https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8280/
- Guidelines for Human Rights Protocol and Architecture Considerations: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-hrpc-guidelines/
- List of RFCs/Internet Drafts with a human rights considerations section: https://etherpad.ietf.org/p/human_rights_considerations

## Process

People in HRPC who are using RFC 8280 to guide their reviews could:

- Send a message to HRPC about drafts that might be interesting because of a) clear connection to RFC 8280, b) requests from authors or engagement with RFC 8280 in the I-D drafting process, or c) existence of a human rights considerations section in an I-D.

- CC HRPC if someone in HRPC conducts a review and cites RFC 8280,

- Start a discussion on the list and in meetings about learnings gleaned from the review process when using RFC 8280 or the guidelines draft.

## To suggest a new draft for analysis:

- Bring the draft up on the hrpc mailinglist
- Create a new issue! Use the Suggested-Draft template while creating the issue.

## To add a new analysis:
Simply add the file to the top-level of the project. 

## What format should I use for the analysis?
Generally the questions that are posed in draft-irtf-hrpc-guidelines are answered for the drafts that you are evaluating.

## When you finished your analysis
You can share your analysis with the authors of the draft(s) you analyzed, the relevant Working Group or Research Group for the draft(s).

In terms of uniformity you can consider starting your review of with the following text:

Human Rights reviews are developed by a group of individuals in the IRTF and IETF. They work together to encourage each other to do these detailed reviews as contributions to the IETF open review process. Human Rights reviews are individual contributions that are being used to apply and evalute RFC8280 and draft-irtf-hrpc-guidelines-02. The authors hope that the comments will be taken into consideration by the draft authors, groups and IESG.
